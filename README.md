## Overview of Pyber Analysis:

V. Isualize, the CEO and co-founder of Pyber has requested the following analysis.

1. Replace reading and math scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School with NaN
2. Repeat the school analysis excluding Thomas High School reading 9th grade reading and math scores
3. Provide a written summary on the impacts of excluding the scores in the analysis versus the original analysis
