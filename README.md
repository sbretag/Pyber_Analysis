# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Pyber Analysis:

V. Isualize, the CEO and co-founder of Pyber, has given us a brand new assignment.  The following has been requested.

1. Create a summary data frame of Pyber stats by city type
2. Create a multi-line graph showing total weekly fares by city type
3. Provide a written summary on hot the data differs by city type and how analysis can aid decision-makers at Pyber
